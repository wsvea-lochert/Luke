# Luke
Luke is a Android app made to run human pose estimation models. This project is created as a part of my master project at 
Østfold University College with Forsvarets forskningsinstitutt. 

The goal of the project is to create a human pose estimation (HPE) model to steer a autonomous vehicle
via a smartphone. The model is trained on a dataset of human poses containing 15 keypoints per image. 
To label the dataset I have made a custom web based labeling tool [C3P0](https://github.com/Cosinium/c3po/ "C3p0") utilizing React and Firebase.

More documentation is comming soon.
